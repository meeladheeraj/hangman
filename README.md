# hangman
-- Hangman is a game in which we will be displaying the hang man game logo and ask the user to guess a letter. 
-- The letter is randomly chosen from the list that we predefined.
-- We will be giving the player 6 chances.
-- If the chosen letter is in the word then we will be showing where the letter is located in the given word. 
-- If not, we will be displaying the transformation of hang man and display the "Wrong" message. 
-- If he could not guess within 6 chances, we print a "Loser" message. 
-- If he is able to guess, then we will be printing "Winner" message on the screen.
-- Finally, we will be printing the correctÂ word on the screen in both the cases
